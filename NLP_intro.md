# Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP combines knowledge from computer science, linguistics, and cognitive science to create algorithms that can process text and speech as humans do.

Some common NLP tasks include:

- Sentiment analysis
- Named entity recognition
- Machine translation
- Text summarization
- Chatbots and conversational agents

## Using Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are a popular tool in the field of NLP because they provide an interactive environment for writing and executing code, as well as documenting your work. You can create, share, and collaborate on Jupyter Notebooks with others, which makes them a great resource for learning and teaching.

In this example, we will use a Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate a simple Python script that counts tokens (words) in a Markdown file. The script will also handle errors and log important events, errors, and warnings.
